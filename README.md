# CS 442 MP6: Final Project

## 1. Overview

This last machine problem in the class is an open-ended one. You will be
building a mobile application of your choice using the Flutter framework. You
are free to choose any application domain you like, but your application must
meet the requirements described below.

## 2. Requirements

Your application must meet the following high-level requirements:

1. There should be at least 3 separate screens/pages in your application, each
   of which should be implemented as a separate widget. One of these pages
   should be the default "home" page that is displayed when the application is
   first launched. Navigation between pages can be implemented using any of the
   standard Flutter mechanisms (e.g., `Navigator`, `TabBar`,
   `BottomNavigationBar`, etc.).
2. At least one of the pages in your application should be backed by a stateful
   widget, which in turn should be backed by a custom model class. The model
   class should encapsulate the data that is displayed/manipulated on the page.
   You may choose to use any of the mechanisms we discussed in class (e.g.,
   `setState`, `ChangeNotifier`, `Provider`, etc.) to update the UI on model
   object updates.
3. Your app should persist some user-updateable data across application launches
   in some way. You can use any of the mechanisms we discussed for doing so
   (e.g., `SharedPreferences`, `sqflite`, etc.).
4. Your app should access some data from an external source (e.g., a RESTful API
   or a cloud database like Cloud Firestore) and display it in some way. You may
   use the `http` package, or other third-party packages, to do so. The accessed
   data should be dynamic in some way (i.e., it should change over time, whether
   in response to user input or external events).
5. Your app should include unit, widget, and integration tests.

### 2.1. Implementation details

Becaause of the open-ended nature of this machine problem, we will not be
providing any starter code. You are free to use any of the code we went over in
class as a starting point, but you are not required to do so. All code you
submit should be your own.

Though you may use third-party libraries (as described in the next section), the
main business logic of your application should be written by you and not
outsourced. You should not use any code that you find online or in other
sources.

### 2.2. External packages

We have included the following packages in the `pubspec.yaml` file:

- [`collection`](https://pub.dev/packages/collection): a library that provides a
  set of additional data structures and utilities
- [`flutter_test`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_test): a library that
  provides a set of utilities for writing widget tests
- [`http`](https://pub.dev/packages/http): a library that provides a set of
  high-level asynchronous functions for communicating with HTTP servers
- [`integration_test`](https://pub.dev/packages/integration_test): a library
  that provides a set of utilities for writing integration tests
- [`mockito`](https://pub.dev/packages/mockito): a library that provides a set
  of utilities for mocking classes and objects
- [`path`](https://pub.dev/packages/path): a library that provides a set of
  utilities for manipulating paths
- [`path_provider`](https://pub.dev/packages/path_provider): a library that
  provides a set of utilities for locating files/directories on the filesystem
- [`provider`](https://pub.dev/packages/provider): a library that provides a set
  of utilities for managing and disseminating stateful data
- [`shared_preferences`](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences): a library
  that provides a persistent store for simple data
- [`sqflite`](https://pub.dev/packages/sqflite): a library that wraps SQLite
  functionality for use in Flutter applications
- [`test`](https://pub.dev/packages/test): a library that provides a set of
  utilities for writing unit tests

For this machine problem, you may also make use of other third-party packages
found on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/), provided you request approval in advance.

## 3. Sample projects

Here are some ideas for projects that satisfy the requirements above:

1. Stock/Cryptocurrency tracker: an app that allows the user to search for and
   track stock or cryptocurrency prices. The user can add
   stocks/cryptocurrencies to a watchlist, and the app will display the current
   price and price history. The watchlist can be persisted. Price data can be
   retrieved from a financial data API (e.g.,
   [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co) or
   [CoinAPI](https://www.coinapi.io/))

2. GitHub repository browser: an app that allows the user to browse GitHub
   repositories and view some of their details. The repository data should be
   retrieved from the [GitHub REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest). A list
   of favorite repositories can be persisted.

3. News reader: an app that allows the user to search for and browse news
   articles from a news API (e.g., [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/)). Previous
   searches and bookmarked/read articles can be persisted.

4. Todo-list/Task manager: an app that allows the user to create and manage task
   lists (maybe with categories or sublists) persisted in a cloud database. Some
   form of user identification/authentication (for collaboration) may be
   implemented.

## 4. Testing

In your `REPORT.md` file, please indicate which of the listed platforms you have
tested your app on. We will test your application by building and running it in
one of your selected platforms, and manually verifying that it meets the
requirements outlined above, based on additional information you provide in your
report.

Additionally, you must also include a test suite comprising the following:

- At least 5 distinct unit tests that focus on testing the functionality of your
  model classes.
- At least 5 distinct widget tests that focus on testing the functionality of
  your custom widgets.
- At least one integration test group that demonstrates the correctness of some
  core feature(s) of your app.

## 5. Grading

This machine problem is worth 50 points, broken down as follows:

- 2 points: a completed `REPORT.md` file with the required information. Because
  of the flexible nature of this MP, we ask that you include more information
  that will help us test and evaluate your work. Please read and complete the
  report file carefully. **Without this we will not evaluate your submission!**
- 8 points: there should be at least 3 separate screens/pages in your
  application, each of which should be implemented as a separate widget, and can
  be reach either as the "home" page or via some form of navigation.
- 10 points: at least one of the pages in your application should be backed by a
  stateful widget, which in turn should be backed by a custom model class, which
  makes use of some form of state management.
- 10 points: some user-updateable data is correctly persisted across application
  launches (either locally or in the cloud).
- 10 points: some data is dynamically accessed from an external source (e.g., a
  RESTful or cloud-based API) and displayed it in some way.
- 10 points: the requisite number of unit, widget, and integration tests are
  included, and they pass.

**If your code does not build, you will receive a zero for the machine
problem.**
